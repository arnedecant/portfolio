Hi, I'm Arne, a Belgium-based software engineer with 10+ years of experience, highly specialized in front-end with a keen eye for design and detail. I love building complex interactive tools: the kind that need to be reliable, clear, and pleasant to use even when a lot is going on. I naturally sit in the space between design and development, and I'm very product-minded: I care about how things look, how they feel, and how they behave over time as a real, living product.

## My Journey

I always knew I wanted to do something on the web, but I didn't start out as "the front-end specialist". That happened gradually.

### 2014-2018: RIS

My first job was at a small agency where I worked on WordPress sites for all kinds of clients: local police, event organizers, businesses, portfolios, and more. I handled pretty much the full lifecycle:
- designing and developing the sites
- getting them live
- doing SEO
- setting up email campaigns

Owning all those steps taught me how everything fits together and made me comfortable switching between design thinking and implementation. It's also where CSS/SCSS really hooked me, it went from “just styling” to something I genuinely enjoyed and wanted to get good at. My JavaScript at the time was mostly simple jQuery, but the seeds were planted.

### 2018-2020: Nanopixel

At Nanopixel, I moved into more product-like, interactive work. I worked mainly on Showreal, a sales tool for real-estate showrooms: a kiosk setup with a touch screen and a wall of TVs, all powered by web tech and Node.js behind the scenes.

Some things I'm especially proud of there:
- helping build Showreal from the ground up
- creating a small custom framework for the tool
- solving fun kiosk/touch problems, including a custom physical cylinder with specific touch-points used for navigation

I worked closely with an experienced freelancer who really pushed my JavaScript forward. We didn't have linters or fancy tooling, but we agreed on how to write clean code and stuck to it so well that over time, our code became indistinguishable. That collaboration shaped how I think about code quality, consistency, and communication.

### 2020-Now: Kiswe

I've always been drawn to multimedia, when I started studying, I was genuinely torn between video production and development. Working at Kiswe on tools for live-stream production feels a bit like those two paths merging. 

I work mainly on Kiswe Studio, and sometimes Kiswe Command Center: products used to manage and produce live streams and fan engagement experiences. The problems are niche and interesting: complex UIs, real-time constraints, and the added pressure that comes with anything live.

In the team, I'm both a front-end specialist and a bridge between product and engineering. I pushed for building our own shared component library to keep the look and feel consistent across products, and I took the lead on that library: defining patterns, shaping the API of components, and making sure we solve problems once in a reusable way.

Across every company I've worked at, I've ended up as the go-to person for CSS, the one people come to with strange layout issues or styling bugs that don't quite make sense at first glance.

## How I Work & What I Care About

A few principles guide how I build software:

- **Complex tools, simple experiences**
  I enjoy complex, interactive tools behind the scenes, but I want the experience to feel calm and understandable for the user.
- **Clean, maintainable, readable code**
  I like solving hard UI problems, but I care just as much about leaving behind code that future me (or someone else) can step into without pain.
- **Bridging design and development**
  I'm comfortable talking in both visual and technical terms. I enjoy turning design ideas into well-structured components and nudging things toward a coherent system rather than one-off solutions.
- **Product-minded and UX-focused**
  I don't just ask "how do we build this?" but also "why are we building this?" and "how will it feel in real use?". I like thinking ahead: putting in the extra work now so the product is easier to extend and nicer to use later.

What keeps me motivated is the fact that the products I work on are live and alive. They evolve. Knowing that decisions I make today will either pay off or come back to haunt me pushes me to care about structure, quality, and UX.

## Side Projects & Creative Experiments

Outside of my day job, I like to mix code, visuals, and sound.

A few examples:
- [Video Projection Mapping](https://github.com/arnedecant/video-projection-mapping) ([Live demo](https://arnedecant.github.io/video-projection-mapping/))
  Experiments with projecting visuals onto physical spaces and shapes using web technologies. It's a playground for mixing digital visuals with the physical world.
- [WebGL Webcam Audio Visualizer](https://github.com/arnedecant/audio-visualiser) ([Live demo](https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/webcam-audio-visualizer/))
  This app takes your camera feed and turns it into a particle system: each particle responds both to the color of a specific pixel in the video and to the music being played. It's part experiment in WebGL and real-time graphics, part excuse to combine audio, visuals, and interactivity.

I also like to poke at smaller WebGL and audio-reactive experiments whenever something interesting pops into my head.

## Beyond Code

I'm not only about components and layouts. When I'm not deep in front-end work, you'll probably find me:
- listening to or exploring new **music**
- **gaming**, often overanalyzing UI and interaction patterns along the way
- diving into **art and tech** overlaps, where creativity and code meet
- hanging out with my dogs, **Yuki & Shiro**, who have strong opinions about break times

This portfolio isn't here to sell services or hunt for a new job, I'm happy where I am. It's more of a place to **get to know me**, see what I've worked on, and explore the kind of problems and projects that keep me curious.
